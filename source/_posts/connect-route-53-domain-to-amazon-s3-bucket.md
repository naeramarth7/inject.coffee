In {% post_link hexo-travis-s3-part-2-deploying-to-aws %} we got our site deployed to S3, so it's available to everyone - still **inject.coffee.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com** seems to be an odd domain name and we got our own domain **inject.coffee**, we want to connect to the bucket.

## Route 53

With a domain registered at Amazon Route 53, we have to set up a hosted zone for this Domain. Head over to [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home) Â» **Hosted Zones** and create a new one.

The *NS* and *SOA* records should already be set up for you. What we need now, is at least 1 domain pointing to our S3 bucket.

Hit **Create Record Set**, set the type to `A`, make it an `ALIAS` and select our S3 bucket as the alias target:

This makes our S3 bucket available at **inject.coffee**, but we also want it to be available on the **www** subdomain, so we set up another **A** record pointing to the first one:

### Connecting an non-Route 53 registered Domain

If we have our domain registered with a different registrar than Amazon, we have to change the at our registrar **nameservers** to match the ones given by our Hosted Zones **NS** record.
